Simple Shell Client
-We will write a simple shell in c/c++ and be using the linux vm given for class

-It will be able to do the following:
	-run commands in the foreground 
	-run commands in the background and return control to the terminal and has auto recovery mode if it dies.

Error Conditions that we will check:
	-We will run it with different commands.
	-Quit the program in a variety of ways in order to check the auto recovery.
	-Multiple commands in the background and foreground.
	-Resuming after an abrupt stop
